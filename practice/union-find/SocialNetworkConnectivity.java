/**
 * Problem: Social network connectivity. Given a social network containing n members and a log file containing m
 * timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at
 * which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that
 * the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your
 * algorithm should be mlogn or better and use extra space proportional to n.
